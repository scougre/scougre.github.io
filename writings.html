				<h2>Finding the Joy</h2>
				<p>
					How does one let go of desire in modern America?
					I recently heard a professor in China say that the common consumerist goal of "keeping up with the Jones'" has lead to modern day slavery.
					While this is perhaps a pessimistic way to look at the American dream, it made me think of how letting go of such goals in my life has generally improved my overall enjoyment.
					For most of my high school and college career, I assumed making it into a big tech company was a given ... despite not particularly enjoying any of my programming internships or working on projects as a whole.
					Thus, I distracted myself from this eventual salaryman reality by improving my saxophone improvisation skills and gaming with the lads.
					Compounded with graduating during the pandemic, I found myself in a situation many would consider underemployed.
					I, however, came to not see it that way.
				</p>
				<p>
					35,000 USD a year is not a whole lot of money. Many people in this position would be <em>quickly</em> seeking a new job, but not me.
					Working this job I considered all the horror stories I had heard in other careers: 2 hour commutes, overtime, high stress, rampant layoffs.
					Though I made little, I counted my self lucky to have a stable work-from-home gig.
					That is, until after four years in my long tenured (by modern American standards) career I was invited to a random <time datetime="10:00">10 AM</time> Zoom call where I was laid off with 4 weeks severance.
					While unfortunate, I had been able to take on no debt with my little salary.
					No kids to worry about, no loans to pay back, no gambling addiction to fuel.
					And my journey back into programming began.
				</p>
				<p>
					I always thought programming could only be stressful and was slowly being phased out with AI. But a recent DHH quote really resonated with me: <q>It's more fun to be competant</q>.
					In the past I only compared myself to the other programmers in my class or job.
					A lot of these people were quite impressive in their skills, but what I was truly envious of was how excited they were to program.
					I want to enjoy it, but I just couldn't figure out how.
					I was so scared of running into a problem I couldn't solve that I didn't even try anything new.
				</p>
				<p>
					But that all changed when I got laid off.
				</p>
				<p>
					At this point I pondered to myself: what am I waiting for?
					I'd spent all this time putting pressure on myself with programming.
					I'd heard it all so many times before:
					"You need to do side projects to get a job."
					"You need to practice Leetcode to get a job."
					"You need to show passion to get a job."
					But why do all this just to do I need to do all this?
					Somewhere along the way I lost my purpose.
					It was never about the money, for I was satisfied with 35,000 USD a year.
					It was never about the glory, for I'd become incredible at saxophone and Lost Ark just to find out I didn't care about the applause.
					It was never about the purpose, for someone else's dream is not mine.
					Then what is it all for?
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm reminded of how my joy in running came about.
					For many years, I could not fathom why anything as painful and joyless as running.
					But after I happened to discover that running helped some of my leg issues, I wanted to figure out how to make it more enjoyable.
					Starting with just a mile five days a week, I would experiment with different workout strategies after a single mile became too easy.
					Maybe two miles for four days a week, or three miles three days a week.
					Eventually, I settled for two interval training sessions and a long run on Saturday.
					At first, I dreaded the long run, doubt filling my mind after 2 or 3 mile marker.
					Then I experienced something I've never experienced before: the feeling of accomplishment of hitting 10 miles.
					When I hit the goal I couldn't get enough, forgetting the times when running was something tiresome and dreadful.
					And this is how I plan to approach these projects on the website.
					By taking one step a day I'll eventually get somewhere, but taking no steps I'll get nowhere.
					Perhaps I'll never get a development job and will have to go back to data entry, but I'll at least have something to show for it.
					I want to create things for my soul, and I hope other's will find some enjoyment in my creations as well!
